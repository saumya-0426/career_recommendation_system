## ðŸ§  Abstract

This project presents an intelligent career guidance system that leverages user preferences and real-world data to recommend a personalized career path using the A* search algorithm. The system first assists users in identifying a suitable academic branch based on their prioritiesâ€”such as salary expectations, college reputation, and cutoff scoresâ€”by analyzing a comprehensive dataset of colleges and career trends. It then factors in the user's financial situation, geographic preferences, and value weightings (like cost, location, and ranking) to suggest an optimal college. Based on the selected branch and college, the system recommends trending, cost-effective skillsets and lets users choose a desired career field.

The core of the system employs the A* algorithm to generate the most efficient career path from branch selection to final job placement. Each stageâ€”from education to skill acquisition to internship and employmentâ€”is modeled as a node in a graph, with heuristic scoring to ensure optimal pathfinding aligned with the user's aspirations. The result is a dynamic, data-driven, and highly personalized roadmap that adapts to user inputs and industry trends. This system not only supports informed decision-making but also empowers students to strategically plan their academic and professional journey from an early stage.
